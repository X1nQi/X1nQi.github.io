## 复杂语境

- She shouted **at** her friend across the park so he could hear her.
  - ✅ 正确答案：to
     👉 因为这是为了让对方“听见”，是 shout to sb（出声给某人听）。
     你写了 at，这更像是“冲某人吼”，带情绪。
- The angry customer shouted **to** the waiter because of the bad service.
  - ✅ 正确答案：at
     👉 这里是带着情绪责骂服务员，所以用 shout at sb。
     你写了 to，就变成了“对服务员大声说”，没体现出生气。
- He threw the ball **at** his teammate so she could catch it.
  - ✅ 正确答案：to
     👉 因为是为了让队友接住（传球），所以用 throw to sb。
     你写了 at，这会变成“朝队友砸过去”，就有点凶😅。
- The boy threw a stone at the dog to scare it away.
- Please explain the problem to me more clearly.
- Everyone laughed **to** his silly mistake during the game.
  - ✅ 正确答案：at
     👉 固定搭配 laugh at sb/sth。
     你写了 to ❌，英语里不会说 laugh to。
- She looked at me, but she didn’t say anything.
- The teacher spoke to the class about the homework assignment.
